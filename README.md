# Animated Museum Guide - Built-In AI

This project, **Animated Museum Guide - Built-In AI**, is my submission for the **[Google Chrome Built-in AI Challenge](https://googlechromeai.devpost.com/)**.

The guide is a Chrome Extension that provides museum visitors with an interactive experience. Visitors can interact with an animated character that answers questions, offers navigation assistance, and makes learning fun. This project showcases the integration of Chrome’s built-in AI APIs, including the **Prompt API**.

## Features

- **Voice Interaction**: Users can ask questions verbally, and the guide responds using synthesized speech.
- **Animated Character**: The character lip-syncs and displays emotional reactions during interactions.
- **AI-Powered Responses**: Leverages Chrome’s built-in Prompt API to generate intelligent answers in real-time.
- **Contextual Assistance**: Provides navigation help using the museum’s map and guide.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/animated-museum-guide-built-in-ai.git
   cd animated-museum-guide-built-in-ai

    Load the extension in Chrome:
        Navigate to chrome://extensions/.
        Enable "Developer mode" (toggle switch in the top right).
        Click "Load unpacked" and select the project directory.

    Start interacting:
        Click on the extension icon.
        Use the microphone button to ask questions.

How It Works

    Voice Input: Captures user queries using the Web Speech API.
    AI Processing: Processes queries using Chrome's Prompt API and generates intelligent responses directly in the browser.
    Voice Output: Uses the Web Speech API to provide spoken responses, enhancing user experience.
    Visual Feedback: Animates a character to mimic speaking and emotion based on interactions.
